# Search-Engine
### Melvin Olaverria

## Overview 

This single page, responsive webpage uses the iTunes limited search API in order to look for 
music by artist name, or song name. It displays both the artist name, song name, album/song 
cover, as well as a 29 second preview of the song. 

## Functionality 

Simple, just type in the artist or song name, scroll to find the song you're looking for, then click 
the play button to preview. In some browsers you can download the preview. To come back to the 
search bar, click the golden triangle at the bottom right of the screen. 

## Technologies used 

- HTML - To semantically mark up the webpage. 
- SCSS/CSS - To style the webpage. 
- JavaScript - Add dynamic behavior like scrolling down to the results on submission, keep
navbar on top of page while still scrolling, and of course fetch the API and return a promise
and dictate the behavior of the data received according to specific needs. 
- Bootstrap - Used for it's grid system. 

## Future Improvements 

1. Add limited search number functionality. 
2. Add better styling to audio controls. 
3. Fix scroll back up triangle (sometimes it doesn't work)

## User Stories 

1. As an artist, I would like to be able to preview the songs, so that I can get a better idea if I like it or not. 
2. As a regular user I would like to be able to scroll back up to the search bar in one click, so that I can save time.
